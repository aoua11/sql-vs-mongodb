Slide 1: Introduction

Title: MongoDB vs. SQL
Brief overview of the presentation
Introduction to MongoDB as a NoSQL database and SQL as a relational database
Slide 2: Data Model

MongoDB:
Document-based data model
Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents
SQL:
Relational data model
Organizes data into tables with rows and columns
Slide 3: Schema Design

MongoDB:
Dynamic schema allows for flexibility
No predefined structure, fields can vary within a collection
SQL:
Requires a predefined schema
Enforces structure and data integrity through defined tables, columns, and relationships
Slide 4: Scalability

MongoDB:
Horizontal scalability with sharding
Scales easily across distributed systems
SQL:
Vertical scalability with replication
Scaling up by adding more resources to a single server
Slide 5: Use Cases and Conclusion

MongoDB:
Suitable for applications with rapidly changing data or evolving schemas
Commonly used in real-time analytics, content management systems, and IoT applications
SQL:
Ideal for applications with complex queries and transactions
Commonly used in banking, finance, e-commerce, and traditional enterprise applications
Conclusion:
Both MongoDB and SQL have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases depending on the requirements of the application.
